# Smart Energy Monitoring and Appliance Control Using IoT and NILM

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the source code, deployment configurations, and documentation for a Final Year Project (FYP) titled:

### Smart Energy Monitoring and Appliance Control Using IoT

The project presents an IoT-based smart energy management system that combines real-time power monitoring, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), appliance classification, and automated load control.

The system estimates individual appliance energy consumption from aggregate household power measurements and provides real-time visualization through a web-based dashboard.

The proposed solution integrates IoT hardware, machine learning models, and cloud-ready services to improve energy awareness and support intelligent energy management in residential environments.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of four main layers:

## 📡 1. Data Acquisition Layer

## 🔌 Hardware

| Component                                                                | Purpose                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 ESP32 Microcontroller                                                 | Real-time sensing, MQTT communication, and appliance control                  |
| 🔹 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB)                                          | Edge server hosting Node-RED, Mosquitto, InfluxDB, Grafana, and NILM services |
| 🔹 SCT-013-000 Current Sensor (×4)                                       | Measures current consumption of connected appliances                          |
| 🔹 ZMPT101B Voltage Sensor                                               | Measures AC mains voltage                                                     |
| 🔹 Midpoint Bias Circuit (10 kΩ Resistors, Capacitor, Protection Diodes) | Shifts AC signals into the ESP32 ADC measurement range                        |
| 🔹 4-Channel Relay Module                                                | Enables automated appliance switching and load management                     |


## 🏠 Test Appliances

The system was evaluated using the following household appliances:

| Appliance  | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💡 Lamp    | Low-priority appliance for load shedding tests                      |
| 💻 Laptop  | Medium-priority appliance for load management evaluation            |
| 🍞 Toaster | High-power appliance used for energy monitoring and NILM evaluation |
| ☕ Kettle   | High-priority appliance protected from automatic disconnection      |


---

## ⚙️ 2. Data Processing Layer

### Services

* 📨 Mosquitto MQTT Broker
* 🔄 Node-RED
* 🌐 Flask APIs

Node-RED receives incoming sensor data and forwards it to machine learning services for NILM processing.

---

## 🧠 3. NILM and Classification Layer

### NILM Methods Evaluated

* 📏 Threshold-Based Method
* 🔍 Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM)
* 🤖 Seq2Point Deep Learning Model
* 🏷️ Appliance Classification Model

The Seq2Point model is used as the primary disaggregation model to estimate appliance-level power consumption from aggregate household power data.

The appliance classifier determines the operating status (ON/OFF) of monitored appliances.

🧠 Model Training Environment

The Seq2Point NILM model was trained using Google Colab with GPU acceleration to improve training efficiency and reduce computation time during deep learning model development.

| Item                 | Details                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Platform             | Google Colab                                   |
| Hardware Accelerator | NVIDIA GPU (T4/A100 depending on availability) |
| Framework            | TensorFlow / Keras                             |
| Dataset              | REFIT Energy Dataset                           |
| Primary Model        | Seq2Point CNN                                  |
| Training Epochs      | **100 Epochs**                                 |
| Loss Function        | Mean Squared Error (MSE)                       |
| Optimizer            | Adam                                           |

Reason for Using Google Colab
The local development machine had limited computational resources for training deep learning models. Therefore, Google Colab was utilized to provide GPU acceleration for the Seq2Point model training process. This significantly reduced training time and enabled efficient experimentation with model parameters. The trained model was subsequently integrated into the IoT energy monitoring system deployed on the Raspberry Pi 4 platform.
